# <Password Generator>

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a calculator that would generate a random password based on multiple inputs from the user. When you click on the "generate password" button, you should get a user prompts that ask the user to enter the parameters of their password.

1st: What the length of the password that the user wants to generate.
2nd: Whether the user wants to include lowercase letters in the password.
3rd: Whether the user wants to include uppercase letters in the password.
4th: Whether the user wants to include numebrs in the password.
5th: Whether the user wants to include special characters in the password.

Based on the above criteria, a password is generated with the length selected, and the alphanumeric criteria. Once the password is generated it is displayed on the webpage in the box labeled "Your Secure Password"

## Usage

The calculator is pretty straightforward. All the user needs to do is click on the "Generate Password" button and it should prompt the user for the criteria for their password. Once the password is generated, it can be copied and pasted into any browser or password storage software you would like.
